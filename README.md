# QnE-Python
 Python application equivalent to the Java Quick 'n' Easy counterpart. This program will be focusing on the ApplyTexas college application generation portion of the SPEEDE server.

## What is Quick 'n' Easy?

Quick 'n' Easy (QnE) software is a free Java-based program developed by SPEEDE. It serves as a modern alternative to the traditional DOS platform, enabling users to print and acknowledge both college applications and high school transcripts. The software aims to streamline the process of handling transcripts and applications, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

Key features of Quick 'n' Easy software include:

1. **Java-Based Platform**: QnE is built on Java, making it platform-independent and accessible across various operating systems that support Java.

2. **Transcript and Application Printing**: Users can easily print transcripts using the QnE software. This feature allows educational institutions to produce official transcripts and applications quickly and efficiently.

3. **Transcript Acknowledgment**: QnE facilitates the acknowledgment of received transcripts. This feature is essential for institutions to confirm receipt of transcripts from other educational entities or students.

4. **Integration with SPEEDE Server**: The software seamlessly integrates with the SPEEDE server, a network service designed for the electronic exchange of student transcripts among educational institutions. This integration ensures compatibility and smooth transmission of transcript data.

5. **Testing with TST and SPE Files**: Upon downloading the QnE software, users are encouraged to test it with the SPEEDE server using TST and SPE files. This testing process allows users to familiarize themselves with the software's functionality and ensure its proper operation before handling actual transcript data.

## What is QnE-Python?

QnE-Python is a new project focusing on automating the college application printing process, which is the second key feature of Quick 'n' Easy software. By leveraging Python scripting, QnE-Python aims to enhance the printing functionality of Quick 'n' Easy.

Key enhancements and features of QnE-Python:

1. **Automated Printing**: QnE-Python automates the printing process of transcripts generated by Quick 'n' Easy. This automation eliminates the need for manual intervention, improving efficiency and reducing the likelihood of errors.

2. **Enhanced Stability**: Unlike the Java-based Quick 'n' Easy software, QnE-Python offers improved stability by removing the need to reopen the application after printing 15 to 20 files. This enhancement ensures a smoother printing experience, particularly for large batches of transcripts.

3. **Future Compatibility**: QnE-Python has the potential to remain relevant for all future updates to the .spe file formats. Its adaptable architecture allows for easy integration with new file formats and specifications, ensuring long-term usability.

By focusing on automation and stability, QnE-Python provides a robust solution for application printing, enhancing the functionality of the Quick 'n' Easy software.

## Requirements

The QnE-Python application was written in a Python 3.10 environment.

## How it Works

QnE-Python operates in three main steps to ensure efficient and accurate translations for application printing, enhancing the overall usability of the Quick 'n' Easy software:

1. **Reading a .spe file**: The application reads the target .spe file, extracts student information, and creates a nested list for each student found within it based on a designated markdown text (ST!189!).

2. **Translating Information**: The application iterates through each list's items and follows a specific translation method for easier error handling. These methods dive deeper into methods found in the syntax.py file for less clutter and better explanation generation. Future updates were considered when making this decoupled architecture.

3. **Arranging Text on PDF Pages**: Nested lists are fitted to our report.py file based on the number of lines needed per pdf generation. Pdf pages are given based on the templates selected to fit each application for only what is necessary and nothing more.

## How to Use the Application

Upon starting the application, the user will be prompted to select a .spe file of their choosing. Any other file selected will result in an error message.

The output will then be generated based on the location of the selected by the user in a folder path such as "/{.spe file name}/{application type}/{last name}_{first name}...{loop index}".
